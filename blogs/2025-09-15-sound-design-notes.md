# Sound Design Notes

I gathered a few quick notes from the latest late-night session.

## Tools used

- FM8 for glassy pads
- Analog Heat for gentle grit
- A humble cassette deck for a layer of wobble

## Quick takeaways

1. Less harmonic motion when the drums are sparse keeps focus where it should be.
2. A little re-amping goes a long way; print the results and resist tweaking.
3. Bounce stems early so future-me can build on the textures.
